# Semi-FedSER: Semi-supervised Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition On Federated Learning using Multiview Pseudo-Labeling
This repository contains the official implementation (in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)) of [Semi-FedSER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08810.pdf). If you have any questions, please email me at tiantiaf@gmail.com or tiantiaf@usc.edu.


## Speech Features

We extract a variety of speech representations using OpenSMILE toolkit and pretrained models. You can refer to [OpenSMILE](https://www.audeering.com/research/opensmile/) and [SUPERB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01051) paper for more information.

Below is a listed of features that we include in the current experiment:

## Federated Learning Overview

Let's recap the basic of the FL. 

1. In a typical FL training round shown in the figure below, a subset of selected clients receive a global model, which they can locally train with their private data. 

2. Afterward, the clients only share their model updates (model parameters/gradients) to the central server. 

3. Finally, the server aggregates the model updates to obtain the global model for the next training round.

## Challenge in FL

One major challenge in FL is that high-quality labeled data samples do not often exist, and most data samples are indeed unlabeled. To address this, Semi-FedSER performs the model training, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data samples at the local client. 

Semi-FedSER also incoporate with pseudo-labeling using the idea of multiview pseudo-labeling, and we adopt an efficient yet effective data augmentation technique called: Stochastic Feature Augmentation (SFA). The algorithm of the pseudo-labeling process is below.

In order to further address the gradient drifting issue in non-IID setting of FL, we add the implementation of SCAFFOLD. The final training algorithm is below.
